# Classy Weather App

The Classy Weather App is a React.js application designed to provide users with real-time weather updates in an elegant interface. It includes several key features:

- **Current Weather**: Displays the current temperature, weather conditions, and location.
- **Forecast**: Shows a detailed weather forecast for the upcoming days.
- **Search**: Allows users to search for weather updates by city.

## State Management

- Utilizes `useState` and `useEffect` to manage the weather data and user inputs.
- Functions like `fetchWeather` retrieve weather data from an API and update the UI accordingly.

## Props Usage

- `Search` component receives a handler function to update the weather based on user input.
- `Forecast` and `CurrentWeather` components receive weather data as props to display relevant information.

The app highlights effective state management, prop usage, and component interaction in React, with a focus on clean and intuitive design, customizable through `App.css`.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
